* Software part of monitoring system

** Server 

To make the server functional is necessary to follow the steps in the monitoring-system-server README.
With that done the following steps are as simple as:

#+begin_src bash
docker compose up --build
#+end_src

*** API Description

The server exposes three routes in it's address (by default -> 0.0.0.0:42068):
    - "/" : GET -> This route basically sends as response a Json payload with the server version.
    - "/api/post_ms" : POST -> This route receives a Json payload with the samples from ESP32.
    - "/api/get_samples" : GET -> This route sends all samples stored in the database.

** Data analysis 

*** Dependencies 

To get the dependencies necessary to use the python script is necessary to have pip installed 
and, in the data analysis folder, run the following command:

#+begin_src bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
#+end_src

*** Usage 

To use it is simply run:

#+begin_src bash
python3 main.py
#+end_src

To understand the usage of the CLI simply run:  

#+begin_src bash
python3 main.py -h
#+end_src
