* Monitoring-system project.

Repository dedicated to developing EEL7801 project in all of it's details

** Project Structure.

*** Firmware.

Simple firmware project based on the ESP32 WROOM board, used to sample 
enviromental data such as temperature, humidity, ultraviolet irradiance, etc.
The application sends posts requests to the server, requests which are made 
of one "round" of measurements, meaning that it contains the last measurement 
of each sensor.

*** Software

Separated even further in Server and Frontend.

**** Server 

The server basically receives the data from ESP32 and stores it in the sqlite 
database, also provides api endpoints to retreive the data.

**** Frontend 

The frontend is the webpage designed to show the graph of each measurement type.
To be implemented.
