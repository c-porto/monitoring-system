* Monitoring-system project.

Repository dedicated to developing EEL7801 project in all of it's details

** Project Structure.

*** Firmware.

Simple firmware project based on the ESP32 WROOM board, used to sample 
enviromental data such as temperature, humidity, ultraviolet irradiance, etc.
The application sends posts requests to the server, requests which are made 
of one "round" of measurements, meaning that it contains the last measurement 
of each sensor.

*** Software

Separated even further in Server and Data Analysis.

**** Server 

The server basically receives the data from ESP32 and stores it in the sqlite 
database, also provides api endpoints to retreive the data.

**** Data Analysis 

Data Analysis basically fetches the sensor samples data from the server and 
provides CLI and/or graphical statistics about the data.
